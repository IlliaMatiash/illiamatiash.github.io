# My Weather App
## In this program you can see the weather in your city or in any city of Ukraine
### How can you do this?
  Very simple, in the upper left corner you can select a city or click a button ***YOUR LOCATION*** and the program will automatically find your location.
  
  Then the program will show the name of your city, the time zone in which your city is located, the time of withdrawal of impressions, a description of weather conditions and temperature.
  
### This is  all
***
It was very simple, do you agree with me?
